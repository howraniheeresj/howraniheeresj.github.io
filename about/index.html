	<h1>RESC:Resilient Equitable Sustainable Communities Consulting</h1>
		<p>At RESC Consulting, we believe that all people deserve to live in neighborhoods that are resilient to the impact of climate change like flooding, high heat, and storms. 

All people should be able to access the benefits of sustainability investments like clean air, quality local greenspace, and affordable and comfortable homes and businesses.

However, too often, these benefits are disproportionately distributed and communities of color are often denied their share of resilience and sustainability benefits.  

RESC offers the following services to enable local governments, non profits, and small businesses help achieve these benefits for their residents, stakeholders, and customers: 
Strategic planning 
Group facilitation 
Stakeholder engagement 
Grant scoping and writing 
Racial equity training 
Pilot program development
Program implementation 
Project management
Data visualization and dashboarding
